-- Jason Zweig

Buy low, sell high,
Trees don’t grow to the sky.
Buy right and hold tight,
Sell in May and go away.
As January goes, so goes the year.
Buy the rumor, sell the news,
Buy the dips, sell the rips,
Buy on the cannons, sell on the trumpets.
Don’t fight the tape.
Don’t fight the Fed.
The trend is your friend.
Buy your dollars for 50 cents.
Buy when blood is running in the streets.
The easy money has been made.
When the market gives you lemons, make lemonade.
Cut your losers and let your winners ride.
Never fall in love with a stock.
Hold on for dear life.
Never marry a stock.
Don’t try to catch a falling knife.
Being right too soon is the same as being wrong.
Stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down.
It’s always darkest before the dawn.
Don’t try to get rich in a hurry.
The retail investor is always wrong.
Bull markets climb a wall of worry.
The market is like a coiled spring.
The Fed is pushing on a string.
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
Cash is trash. Cash is king.
This time is different.
It’s a stock picker’s market.
It’s a market of stocks, not a stock market.
Our thesis is still intact.
Sooner or later, stocks always come back.
It’s only a paper loss unless you sell.
You can either sleep well or eat well.
When you get a hunch, bet a bunch.
There’s no such thing as a free lunch.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
Put all your eggs in one basket,
And watch that basket!
Bears make money, bulls make money, but pigs get slaughtered.
When the ducks quack, feed ’em.
The numbers don’t lie.
We think this stock is oversold.
We’re keeping our powder dry.
When the U.S. sneezes, the world catches cold.
A rising tide lifts all boats.
We only buy stocks with competitive moats.
There are old pilots,
And there are bold pilots,
But there are no old, bold pilots.
It’s priced for perfection.
It’s forming a bottom.
We’re overdue for a correction.
It’s finding support.
Nobody ever went broke taking a profit.
We like it because it has hair on it.
Bull markets die of old age.
Bull markets die with a whimper not a bang.
Bull markets don’t die of old age.
Plan your trade, trade your plan.
I’m always a contrarian.
A stopped clock is right twice a day.
Hope is not a strategy.
Failing to plan is planning to fail,
To a man with a hammer everything’s a nail.
There’s never just one cockroach in the kitchen.
We eat our own cooking.
We always invest with conviction.
We have a strict sell discipline.
If you’re so smart, how come you aren’t rich?
They always beat the consensus.
I only swing when I get a fat pitch.
We always swing for the fences.
We hit for singles, not for home runs.
You wouldn’t pick the cheapest surgeon, why pick the cheapest funds?
We remain constructive on these stocks.
Where are the customers’ yachts?
