  * Write/"writers write"/keep writing (multiple contributors)
  * Persist (multiple)
  * Elements of a story:
    * Setting, character with specific, concrete desire + obstacle
    * How did protagonist overcome the obstacle? What was the outcome? How did the protagonist or the world change?
  * Learn a foreign language: inculcates discipline and humility, reveals first language in a new light
  * Look for the "terrible fish", i.e., the strangeness or estrangement
  * Tap into your physiology, read your work alound and notice your emotional reactions
  * Embrace (really) bad first drafts (multiple), then edit; read aloud (again)
  * speaking words: be short, punch, and clear; use one-syllable words and clear structure: A then B then C
  * make discoveries; write teh beats or scenes you are eager to write, then fill in
  * keep trying new things, SFD, don't give in to self-doubt
  * critically examine what you're drawn to -- what interests you? what in your psychology makes that interesting?
  * know where you are in place and time. describe and explain them, make them come alive with detail. "Nothing happens nowhere."
  * bring your reader to the scene: smells, textures. Use abstractions sparingly.
  * read a lot, especially if you plan to have kids later
  * give yourself a deadline with a person to show your work to at the end (cf. Don't Read Poetry)
